This is Homework 0, Question 9. Presumably you have already cloned the repo <https://github.com/bmacGTPM/361-Spring-2024> in order to get this file, but if you haven't, do that now. Create a new branch and name it your first and last name. Make an edit to this R Markdown file `pset00-GitHub-pull-request-Firstname-Lastname.Rmd` to have your name at the top instead of mine, and the current date instead of Jan 15, 2024. Also change the filename to include your first and last name. Commit that to your branch, push those commits to Github, and create a pull-request to the `main` branch.
